## Abstract

Colorectal cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the large intestine resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of one of the cells making up the colorectal tract. 
In Western countries, colorectal cancer is the second largest malignant tumor after that of the breast in women and the third after that of the lung and prostate in men. 
Risk factors for this kind of cancer include colon polyps, long-standing ulcerative colitis, diabetes II and genetic history (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome). 
In order to get information about diagnosis, therapy evaluation on colorectal cancer, analysis on radiological images can be performed through the application of dedicated algorithms.
In this scenario, the correct and fast identification of the cancer regions is a
fundamental task. 
Up to now this task is performed using manual or
semi-automatic techniques, which are time-consuming and
subjected to the operator expertise.
The aim of this project is to provide an automated pipeline to predict the response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy of patients affect by colorectal cancer.
