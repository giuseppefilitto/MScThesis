\section{Description}
We have seen that the pipeline development consists of various steps.
In this section I will describe how each step of the pipeline was achieved.
The first one is the pre-processing.
Then, the training of the Convolutional Neural Network and the segmentation will be described following.
After that, the description of radiomic features extraction and analysis.
Finally the prediction of response.\\
This section is aimed only to the description since the implementation will be treated in the next one.
