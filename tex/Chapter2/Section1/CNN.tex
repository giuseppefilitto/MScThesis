\markboth{CHAPTER 2. ANN}{}
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of Artificial Neural Networks commonly applied to analyze visual imagery\cite{wiki:cnn, CNN}.
The word \textit{Convolutional} indicates that the network employs convolution operations.
CNNs architecture consists of an \textit{input layer}, \textit{hidden layers} and an \textit{output layer}.
The hidden layers are the ones that perform convolutions.
As the convolution kernel slides along the input matrix for the layer, the convolution operation generates a feature map, which in turn contributes to the input of the next layer\cite{wiki:cnn, CNN}.
This process can be followed by other layers such as \text{pooling layers}, \textit{ReLu layers}, and \textit{Loss layers}.
