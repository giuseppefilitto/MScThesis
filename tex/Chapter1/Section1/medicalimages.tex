\section{Medical Digital Images}

A medical digital image is the digital representation of the anatomical (or functional) structure of the patient.
It is composed by a finite number of picture elements called \textit{pixels}.
A pixel is a discrete numeric representation of intensity or gray-level, that is an output coming from a two-dimensional function $f(x, y)$ fed as input by its spatial coordinates denoted with $(x, y)$ on the x-axis and y-axis\cite{Gonzalez}.\\
A digital image can be processed by computers.
This process is called \textit{digital image processing}.
It is useful to divide the mentioned process into two main categories: (\textit{image processing}) and (\textit{image analysis}).
The former includes methods whose output and input data are images.
The latter includes methods whose input data can be images and the output data are attributes extracted from the images.
