\section{Medical Digital Images}

A medical digital image is the digital representation of the anatomical (or functional) structure of the patient.
It is composed by a finite number of elements called \textit{pixels}.
A pixel is a discrete numeric representation of intensity or gray-level. It is an output coming from a two-dimensional function $f(x, y)$. 
The input of this function consists in the spatial coordinates, denoted with $(x, y)$ on the x-axis and y-axis of the image plane\cite{Gonzalez}.\\
A digital image can be processed by computers.
This process is called \textit{digital image processing} and it can be divided into two main categories: (\textit{image processing}) and (\textit{image analysis}).
The former includes methods whose output and input data are images.
The latter includes methods whose input data can be images and the output data are attributes extracted from the images.
