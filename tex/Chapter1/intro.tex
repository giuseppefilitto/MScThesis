\chapter{Medical Digital Images}

A medical digital image is the representation of the anatomical (or functional) structure of the patient composed by a finite number of picture elements called \textit{pixels}. 
Each pixel is a discrete numeric representation for its intensity or gray-level, that is an output coming from its two-dimensional function $f(x, y)$ fed as input by its spatial coordinates denoted with $(x, y)$ on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively \cite{Gonzalez}.\\
A digital image can be processed by computers, this process is called \textit{digital image processing}.
It is useful to divide the mentioned process into two main categories: the methods whose output and input data are images (\textit{image processing}) and the methods whose input data can be images and the output data are attributes extracted from the images themselves (\textit{image analysis}).\\
