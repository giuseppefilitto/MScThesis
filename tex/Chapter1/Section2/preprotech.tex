\section{Pre-processing techniques}
Pre-processing is a common name for operations with images. 
Both input and output are images. 
The aim of pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses unwilling issues such as noise or enhances some image features important for further processing\cite{pre-processing}.
\\
For the development of this project, the pre-processing involves a denoising filtering technique and a gamma correction to improve the contrast.
