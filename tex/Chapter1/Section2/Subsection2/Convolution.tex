\subsection{Correlation and Convolution}


Spatial filtering is a correlation or convolution process.
Correlation is the process of moving a \textit{mask} or \textit{kernel} over the image and computing the sum of products at each location\cite{corrandconv}.
The mechanics of convolution are the same, except that the filter is first rotated by $180^{\circ}$ degree.
In other words, correlation or convolution are filter shift functions.\\
The correlation and convolution of a filter $w(x, y$) of size $m \times n$ with an image $f(x, y)$ can be written as follow:

\begin{align}
    Correlation:  w(s, t) \times f(x, y) = & \sum_{s = -a}^{a} \sum_{t = -b}^{b} w(s, t) f(x + s, y + t) \\
    Convolution:  w(s, t) \circledast f(x, y) = & \sum_{s = -a}^{a} \sum_{t = -b}^{b} w(s, t) f(x - s, y - t) 
\end{align}
