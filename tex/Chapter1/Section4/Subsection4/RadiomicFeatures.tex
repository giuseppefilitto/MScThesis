\subsection{Radiomic Features}

Radiomic features can be divided into five groups\cite{wiki:Radiomics, tesicoppola}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item size and shape basedâ€“features like descriptors of the image intensity histogram, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM);
    \item run length matrix (RLM);
    \item size zone matrix (SZM);
    \item neighborhood gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM) derived textures, textures extracted from filtered images;
    \item fractal features.
\end{itemize}
