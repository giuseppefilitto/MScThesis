\section{Radiomics}
Radiomics consists in methods that, using data-characterization algorithms, extracts from medical images, a large number of features which have the potential to uncover disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye\cite{wiki:Radiomics}.
The main objective of radiomics is to assist the subjective interpretation of the clinitians with an objective prediction of all those data invisible to the radiologist, transforming medical images into data, defined as \textit{biomarkers}\cite{tesicoppola}.
In the new era of precision medicine, radiomics is an emerging translational research field that aims to find associations between qualitative and quantitative information extracted from clinical images and clinical data to support decision making process.
