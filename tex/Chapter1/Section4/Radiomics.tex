\section{Radiomics}
Radiomics consists in methods that extract from medical images a large number of features, which have the potential to uncover disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye\cite{wiki:Radiomics}.
The main objective of radiomics is to assist the subjective interpretation of the clinicians with an objective prediction.
In the new era of precision medicine, radiomics is an emerging translational research field that aims to find associations between qualitative and quantitative information extracted from clinical images and clinical data to support the decision making process\cite{tesicoppola}.
Radiomic features can be divided into different classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First Order Statistics
    \item Shape based features 2D and 3D
    \item Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
    \item Gray Level Size Zone (GLSZM)
    \item Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM)
    \item Neighbouring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM)
    \item Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM)
\end{itemize}
