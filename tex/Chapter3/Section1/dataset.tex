\section{Dataset Description}
The main dataset used for this project was provided by IRCCS Santâ€™Orsola-Malpighi Polyclinic.
It consists of MRI scans from 48 patients affected by colorectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy, from January 2018 to the end of December 2019.
The scans are provided slice by slice in DICOM format.
The scans are T2-weighted images resulting in images that highlight fat (low signal) and water (high signal) within the body.
\\
Within the scans, also manual annotations, made by expert clinicians, were provided.
The manual annotations consist of sets of $(x, y)$ points that border the tumor area on the relative image.
\\
Clinical data were also provided through a dedicated database.
Among the information stored, the clinical database contains the Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) which indicates the degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy.
