The pipeline was developed and applied on the dataset provided by the IRCCS Santâ€™Orsola-Malpighi Polyclinic, described in the first section.
\\
The performance of the pipeline was evaluated for both the main frameworks: \textit{segmentation} and \textit{prediction of response}.
\\
The possible outputs of the implementation will be also shown in this chapter.
