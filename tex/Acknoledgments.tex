I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this work.
\\
First of all, my parents and all my family, that with their tireless support, both moral and economic, allowed me to get here today.\\
I particularly thank my uncles who have become a second family for me, and Mariella who has ever been to my side during these years, since the first day.\\
A special thank to Nicole, which has ever believed and supported me.   \\
I would like to thank Prof. Gastone Castellani for the project and the availability.\\
Last but not least I would really like to thank Dr. Nico Curti, for the availability and precision shown to me throughout the working period. Without him, I would not have learned and improved as much as I did so far.
